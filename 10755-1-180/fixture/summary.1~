The fixture file will be initialized using values from a fixture
   default object.  All fixture options in the board file will be ignored
   except for fixture size and type.
   
   The default object is ./fixture_defaults.o. (WARNING BPL88)

Inserted fixture part number "44200S" into the fixture object file.
   The fixture part number was selected based on the fixture parameters
   specified.  If you wish to use an alternative fixture part number, please
   list the fixture object and replace the fixture part number in the fixture
   file with one of the other recognized part numbers described in the manual.

Trying to find a placement for the board that is compatible
   with the board handler.

  with a rotation of  90.000 degrees.
